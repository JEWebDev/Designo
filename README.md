## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Zod

### What I learned

Things that i had to learn to complete this challenge:

- react-router-dom
- controlled forms in react
- validation with zod
- reusable components and layouts with react
- leaflet for interactive maps
- deploying a page with netlify

### Continued development

I will investigate more about the aria labels and how to implement accessibility best practices.

Use css variables consistently, this project i didn't bother too much, but it is a good practice and a fundamental one specially when implementing dark mode

Project folder structure, i will improve the folder structure on future projects, so there will be less folders and better folder structure.
